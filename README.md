Organization’s Background
The Emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM
The emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM is out of our deepest concerns on the low-income earner families particularly who were affected by armed conflicts between the gov’t troops and rebel groups, who are living with extended relatives, no permanent house and anywhere in this city and nearby areas, who are classified as low-income earners, with less education and livelihood skills and through series of studies with a group of Professionals and friends from different sectors of society but with one common objective; to help the needy.
The Kambantangan Sa Kapagongaya Peace Advocates, Incorporated is instrumental in establishing and providing programs for housing, social services, education and skills training for its members.
It is a primary source of essential services and administers comprehensive programs involving social services, health, education, occupational and assisted housing.
It provides fundamental social services involving counseling and values formation in a variety of social, health and family related programs.
